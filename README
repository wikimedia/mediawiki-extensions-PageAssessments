This extension is for the purposes of storing article assessments as they happen in a new database table.
This extension was designed keeping in mind Wikiprojects use-cases but they can be used for a number of other similar purposes.

The parser function for invoking a new review is: {{#assessment: <Name of the wikiproject> | <Class> | <Importance>}} where 'assessment'
is a magic word.

The assessment parser function is expected to be on the Talk page of the page under review, however it may be included on the main page itself.

A page may have more than one assessment function for different projects.

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PageAssessments for further documentation.
